  summary: 'Bourne Again Shell'
  description: |
    Bash is the GNU Project's shell. Bash is the Bourne Again SHell.
    Bash is an sh-compatible shell that incorporates useful features
    from the Korn shell (ksh) and C shell (csh). It is intended to
    conform to the IEEE POSIX P1003.2/ISO 9945.2 Shell and Tools standard.
    It offers functional improvements over sh for both programming and
    interactive use. In addition, most sh scripts can be run by Bash
    without modification.
